    <img class="profile-img"  src="" alt="">
    <h4>Hi, my name is Beryl and welcome to my website.</h4>
    <p>I am training to become a software engineer by being on bootcamp called Blackcodher.
        I am not from the traditional route of going to university and studying computer science. I instead studied psychology.</p>
    
    <p>This page is dedicated to my coding skills, which will include my future projects and past projects as well as the languages I am learning.
        I will use these skills to become a full stack developer and from there brunch into cyber secuiry. I will be documenting my journey and showing projects that I do, so feel free to use this as one of your self help resources.
    </p>
