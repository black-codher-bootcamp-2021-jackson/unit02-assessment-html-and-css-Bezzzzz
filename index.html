          <h4>About me</h4>
          <p>
            I'm currently in training to become a software developer, which has
            been amazing!<br />
            Some of you might be reading this and expecting me to write that I
            went to univeristy <br />
            and did computer science and to that I say No! <br />
            Now, I did go to university and study psychology but I have always
            had an interest in coding and decided to teach myself some laguages
            like HTML basics using <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">FreeCodeCamp.</a> I then decided I want this a
            career and came across Blackcodher Bootcamp, and this opputunity has
            been <strong>AMAZING!</strong> <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            This is my first portfolio and but over the years, I want to be able
            to look back at this page and be able to show improvements to my
            coding knowledge.<br />
            I would like to get into cyber security over the years after
            building up a solid foundation.

                After I graduated I found myself a part-time job and then Lockdown hit and that's when I

      <h3>My future projects</h3>
      <p class="text-h3">Here is a lsit of future language projects for the next six months:</p>
      <ul class="projects">
        <li>
          Javascript project which will be an interactive timeline on the
          history of baking
        </li>
        <li>React project</li>
        <li>Node project</li>
        <li>MongoDB project</li>
        <li>
          I will also create a personal project which will hopefully be an app
          that is a catalogue for many disabilities, whereby a user can become
          further educated on their own disability or the app can be used as
          guidence for those who know of somebody with a disability.
